                <ul>
                    <li>This project is our try to share the resources that we have found throughout our journeys at IIT.
                            We deem this work an <strong>incomplete, unexhausted guide</strong>.</li>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>All IIT students, especially incoming out-of-state or international freshmen.</li>

                <h2>Goals of this Project</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give an overview and a sense of direction of interesting, relatively safe, and pedestrian-friendly places 
                        students new to Chicago might want to visit.</li>
                    <li>Give a brief and quick way to students to find basic information on a variety of places, 
                        from restaurants to museums to grocery stores and more. Each specific location has been given a walkability score, on a scale out of 100, 
                        which serves to represent both how easy it is to reach on foot as well as how many different sorts of nearby services and businesses 
                        can be reached on foot in the surrounding area.</li>
                    <li>Give some practical tips on how to maximize students' living experience.</li>
                </ul>
