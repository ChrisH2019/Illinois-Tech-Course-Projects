## Project Description

In this project, we performed the analysis experiment on the `Jupyter Notebook` platform. We downloaded 1,000 tweets using tweepy API, wrangled the data set using `Pandas`, visualized and analyzed the network using `Networkx` and `Matpotlib.pyplot`.

## Files Included

* `tweets.txt`: a data set contains 1,000 tweets in raw text format
* `cs579_social_network_analysis.ipynb`: a jupyter notebook contains all the source code
* `report.pdf`: a written report for the project
* `README.me`: README file

## How to Run

Open the `.ipynb` file named `cs579_social_network_analysis.ipynb`, and run the cells from top to bottom.
